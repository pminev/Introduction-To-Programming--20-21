## Memory management

From now on, each variable will have those features:
- Type (int, double, etc.)
- Name (how we refer to that variable)
- Storage size (how much memory the variable takes in bytes)
- Storage type (in which type of memory the variable is stored)
- Address (where in the memory is our variable)
- Scope (from where we can see/access the defined variable)
- Lifetime (when the variable is created and when destroyed)

### Consider also:
Reading the whole book [Understanding and using C pointers](https://doc.lagout.org/programmation/C/Understanding%20and%20Using%20C%20Pointers%20%5BReese%202013-05-18%5D.pdf), will help you to fully understand what is the deal with pointers and memory management.
